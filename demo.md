!Testing to see if git is installed !!
	git --version
	
When you use stages!!
------------------------------
Unstaged : You've made additions and changes that you aren't sure you want to keep
Staged: You're pretty sure you want to keep the changes
Committed: YOu definitely want to keep the changes
Pushed: You want to share the changes with others

Useful git commands !!
---------------------------------
git status - Provides useful information
git add - Moves one or more files from unstaged to staged
git commit - Commits any staged files 
git push - Uploads commited files to GitHub

What happens when you make a changes !!!
-------------------------------------
File is automatically Unstaged
Do a git add to stage it
You still have a chance to chage it before committing 
 if you do you will need to do  git add again to stage it again
Do a git commit to commit it
Do a git oush to upload it to GitHub
Note that although I will show you how to do this for one file,you can use any of these commands for multiple files

Testing Pull !!
