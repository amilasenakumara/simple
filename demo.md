Unstaged : You've made additions and changes that you aren't sure you want to keep
Staged: You're pretty sure you want to keep the changes
Committed: YOu definitely want to keep the changes
Pushed: You want to share the changes with others

Useful git commands

git add - Moves one or more files from unstaged to staged
git commit - Commits any staged files 
git push - Uploads commited files to GitHub
